# 📖 Vet clinic <a name="about-project"></a>


**Vet Clinic Database Project**
This project involves the creation of a PostgreSQL database named "vet_clinic" and the design of a table called "animals" with various attributes to store information about the clinic's patients. Additionally, data is inserted into the table to represent a sample of animals with unique characteristics.

Project Components:
Schema Definition (schema.sql): The database schema is defined with the table structure, including columns such as id, name, date_of_birth, escape_attempts, neutered, and weight_kg.

Data Insertion (data.sql): Sample data is inserted into the "animals" table, representing four unique animals, each with its own set of attributes.

SQL Queries (queries.sql): A series of SQL queries are crafted to answer specific questions or "quests" related to the animals in the database. These queries extract valuable insights from the data.

Quests: The queries include tasks such as finding animals by name patterns, birth years, neutered status, escape attempts, weight ranges, and more.

Query Results: Screenshots of the results obtained from executing the SQL queries are included in the project to visually demonstrate the outcome of each quest.

This project is a practical exercise in working with databases, SQL, and data retrieval. It showcases the ability to design a database schema, populate it with data, and extract meaningful information through structured queries.
